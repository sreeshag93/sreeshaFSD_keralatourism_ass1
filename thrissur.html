                    <p>OBuilt after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold. Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of Cochin.

                        In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs, thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a travellerâ€™s dream.

                    <h1> Athirappilly Waterfalls</h1>
                    <p>On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala. 

                        The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

                        The Kerala Kalamandalam was what gave three main arts of Kerala a new life, namely Kathakali, Kudiyattam, and Mohiniyattam. For the sake of performing arts, and if you are someone who is a fanatic for them, this is definitely the place to be. The best part is that the institute is housed on the banks of the Bharathapuzha River.

                    <p>
                        In the town of Guruvayur near Thrissur, the Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple stands as a true testimony of not only the devotion of the people of the state but also of the fine arts and crafts that Kerala is well known for.

                        Dedicated to the Hindu God, Guruvayurappan, the temple is one of the most sacred locations for the Hindus residing in Kerala. Inside the temple, you can find a number of artefacts that showcase the beauty of the handiwork of Kerala. 
                        
                        The best part of visiting the temple is that when it is lit during celebrations, the glow of the red and brick structure is a sight worth beholding.
