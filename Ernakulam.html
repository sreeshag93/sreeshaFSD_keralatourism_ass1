                    <p>This beach drawing several tourists is located in a coastal village, located 4km of Pattanakkad.

                        Though seriously affected by the Tsunami in 2004, a brand new bridge and an aerial walkway have been constructed to the sea wall for a magnificent view of a dramatic sunset to cherish for a lifetime.

                        The flooring of the palace is a sight to behold, as because it looks like polished black marble, but has been made the traditional Kerala way using burnt coconut shells, lime, charcoal, egg white etc giving a lasting finish. The reputation of the Palace is in the various murals painted in warm and rich colours the tempura style.

                    <p>
                        Chinese fishing nets, also known as Cheena wala are seen quite frequently in Kochi. These are stationary lift nets fixed at a particular place operated from the shore using mechanical contrivances to fishing nets almost 20m across. 

This unique way of fishing was introduced by the Chinese traders in the 14th century extending its relevance to “Ko-chi”, meaning China like. Sunsets across the backwaters, rivers or sea offer a panoramic splendour of the skyline with silhouettes of Chinese fishing nets in the backdrop.
