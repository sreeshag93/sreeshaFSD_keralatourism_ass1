The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. 

                        All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river..</p>
